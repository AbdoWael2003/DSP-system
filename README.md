# Digital Signal Processing System
## It's a digital signal processing system built from scratch using Python.
## The system involves multiple signal operations, including:
  basic operations like folding, shifting, scalling, normalizing, etc.
  Creating random signals
  Quantization
  Fast Fourier Transform(DFT,IDFT,DCT)
  Smoothing and sharpening,
  Convolution and correlation
  Resampling
  Creating filters to be convolved, like:
  low pass
  high pass
  band pass
  band stop
## The system contains visualizations and a GUI but needs more development.
## The system deals with the outputs and inputs in the form of files with a given format.
## Finally, the current state of the system is under refactoring and cleaning the code a bit because it is not organized in the right way.
