# Digital Signal Processing System
## It's a digital signal processing system built from scratch using Python.
## The system involves multiple signal operations, including:
  basic operations like folding, shifting, scalling, normalizing,
  Creating random signals,
  Quantization,
  Fast Fourier Transform(DFT,IDFT,DCT),
  Smoothing,
  sharpening,
  Convolution,
  correlation,
  Resampling,
  Creating filters to be convolved, like:
  low pass,
  high pass,
  band pass,
  band stop
## the signals folder contains the output txt files from any window
## The system contains visualizations and a GUI but needs more development.
## The system deals with the outputs and inputs in the form of files with a given format.
## Finally, the current state of the system is under refactoring and cleaning the code a bit because it is not organized in the right way.
